# Pig-Dice-Game
## This is a Dice game called Pig which is accredited to John Scarn a magician who in 1945 first printed it. In this game there are two players who each roll the dice and add each roll until the dice produces a 1, then its the other users turn to do the same. Each user has an opportuntiy at the end of each roll to store their accumulated dice roll before they inneviteably roll a 1 and lose the score they failed to store, if a user stores their score their turn passes to the next user and their score increases by the stored value. The game ends when one user reaches 100 and wins.
## The purpose of this is to demonstrate JavaScript fundamentals and a good understanding of DOM manipulation I will add a flowchart I created online to show the process:
